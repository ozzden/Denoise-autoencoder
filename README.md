PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
PSNR is typically expressed in decibels (dB), and higher values indicate better quality:

Below 20 dB: Generally considered poor quality. This range is often seen in heavily compressed or very noisy images.
20 dB to 30 dB: Fair quality, which might be acceptable for some applications but not for uses where high fidelity to the original is critical.
30 dB to 40 dB: Good quality, generally acceptable for many applications including some broadcast standards.
Above 40 dB: Excellent quality. Images with PSNR values in this range are usually indistinguishable from the original to the human eye. This range is typically targeted in professional fields where high image fidelity is crucial.
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)
SSIM ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity to the original image:

Below 0.5: Poor similarity, indicating significant differences from the original image. This might occur with high levels of noise or distortion.
0.5 to 0.7: Moderate quality, where the image may be noticeably different from the original but still contains a significant amount of the original detail.
0.7 to 0.9: Good quality, with the image closely resembling the original. Most differences are subtle and may not be noticeable without close inspection.
Above 0.9: Excellent quality, where differences from the original image are very minor and often imperceptible to casual observation.
